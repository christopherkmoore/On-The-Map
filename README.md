Finally getting into API's!

On the Map is the fourth Udacity project where I started working with MapKit, and created my first API function from scratch.

Drop a pin on a map and share your location with fellow students. See the results in a table view!

The app is swift 2.2 and will run in Xcode legacy mode.
